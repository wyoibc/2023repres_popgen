## Overview

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most widely used version control system. Git tracks changes to files (including code scripts) and allows you to revert to older versions of files if necessary. This means that as you are working on code, you don't need to make and keep multiple versions of the same script in case any new changes break your pipeline. Having a single file with tracked changes is much easier than trying to keep track of multiple different versions of the same file or trying to remember to remember which of `script_v8_FIXED.R` or `script_v8_FINAL.R` is the correct script with your most recent edits.

[Github](https://github.com/) is the most commonly used Git repository hosting service (you can see a list of some others [here](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-hosting-services-compared/)). Github allows Git users to easily access their code from anywhere, share and collaborate on projects, and host websites. The tutorials for this workshop are all hosted in a Github repository, as you've likely already noticed.

I use Git + Github for code for all of my research papers, both to keep the code tracked and to share the code when publishing manuscripts. E.g., a paper I published in early 2023 links to [this Github repo](https://github.com/seanharrington256/Lgetula_gbs) so that anyone can see my code and replicate my analyses.



* Git is completely free and open source, Github is a for-profit company, and some features of Github can require a paid account. Most academic users will be able to get by with a free Github account without any issues.

Mention google drive as an option for writing papers, etc.

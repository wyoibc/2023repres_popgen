## Overview

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most widely used version control system. Git tracks changes to files (including code scripts) and allows you to revert to older versions of files if necessary. This means that as you are working on code, you don't need to make and keep multiple versions of the same script in case any new changes break your pipeline. Having a single file with tracked changes is much easier than trying to keep track of multiple different versions of the same file or trying to remember to remember which of `script_v8_FIXED.R` or `script_v8_FINAL.R` is the correct script with your most recent edits.

[Github](https://github.com/) is the most commonly used Git repository hosting service (you can see a comparison of some others [here](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-hosting-services-compared/)). Github allows Git users to easily access their code from anywhere, share and collaborate on projects, and host websites. The tutorials for this workshop are all hosted in a Github repository, as you've likely already noticed.

I use Git + Github for code for all of my research papers, both to keep the code tracked and to share the code when publishing manuscripts. E.g., a paper I published in early 2023 links to [this Github repo](https://github.com/seanharrington256/Lgetula_gbs) so that anyone can see my code and replicate my analyses.



* Git is completely free and open source, Github is a for-profit company, and some features of Github can require a paid account. Most academic users will be able to get by with a free Github account without any issues.

## Create a Github account and repository

We'll start by creating a repository on Github. If you don't already have a Github account, go to [Github](https://github.com/), click `Sign up` in the upper right, create an account. If you already have an account, sign in. Once signed in, click on the `+` button in the upper right:

and then `New repository`. This should open a page that looks like this:

In "Repository name" enter 2023popgen. This will obviously be the name of the repository, but will also be part of the web address to the Github page for the repository as well as the name of the directory for the git repository when you clone it to your own computer, Beartooth, or another server.

In Description, you can enter something like Repo for 2023 Popgen workshop. This should be relatively brief, more detail about the repository and files it contains will go into the Readme file. 

Below Description, you can select whether to make the repository public or private. If the repository contains files and code that you want to be made available to anyone, you should keep it public (e.g., code that accompanies a paper you've published). Private repositories are used if you have code that is proprietary or if you don't want others to know what you are working on. You can switch repositories between private and public after creation, so you can keep a repository private while working on analyses and then make it public for review and publication if you like.


We can leave the rest of the options at defaults and click `Create repository`. You should now have an empty Github repository. Weâ€™ll use Git on Beartooth to add the contents of this repository.

## Notes during development

Mention google drive as an option for writing papers, etc.

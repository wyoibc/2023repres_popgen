## Hardware requirements:

Everyone will need a laptop capable of accessing the internet and installing software. If you need to borrow a laptop, we have several loaners. **Contact me well ahead of the workshop if you need to borrow a laptop.**

## Cluster access prep:

**Everyone will need an account on Beartooth.** Beartooth is the University of Wyoming's high performance computing cluster. **Gaining access can sometimes take a few days, and I have no control over this. If you come to the workshop without a valid Beartooth account, you will not be able to follow along and I will not be able to help.**

If you have never used Beartooth before, check with your PI to see if they have an existing project on Beartooth that they can add you to. You can be added to a project by using the form [here](https://arccwiki.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/group/15/create/36) and filling out the relevant fields.

If your PI does not have an existing project, then have them request a new project [here](https://arccwiki.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/group/15/create/44) (or fill out the form yourself with their permission).

Once you have an account, follow ARCC's documentation [here](https://arccwiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCUMENTAT/pages/1591705653/Getting+Started+with+ARCC) and ensure that you can log in to Beartooth.

**All participants, even those that have used Beartooth before, should ensure that they can log in at least a few days before the worksop.** Note that when logging in, as you type your password, it will not fill in with `****` as you type, but will stay blank. This is a point of confusion for many first time users of cluster systems.

If you are unable to figure out how to log in or run into issues, let me know as far ahead of the workshop as possible. All you need is to check that you can log in. You don't need to understand anything further, we'll start from scratch in the Intro to Beartooth session.
